<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Creating an analytic data set is very important when doing data analysis and will be used to reproduce the results.</p>
<p>An analytic data set should include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Variables (observed data) used in the analysis</li>
<li>Variables (observed data) used to construct other variables used in the analysis</li>
<li>Variable labels</li>
<li>Variable coding</li>
</ul>
<p>This presentation uses the R programming language and assumes the end user is taking advantage of RStudio IDE to compile their R markdown files into HTML <span class="citation">(R Core Team <a href="#ref-Rlang2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>; RStudio Team <a href="#ref-Rstudio" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>. All of the files needed to reproduce these results can be downloaded from the Git repository <code>git clone <span>https</span>://git.waderstats.com/creating_an_analytic_data_set/</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="libraries" class="section level1">
<h1>Libraries</h1>
<p>The libraries <i>knitr</i>, <i>bookdown</i>, and <i>kableExtra</i> are used to generate the HTML output <span class="citation">(Xie <a href="#ref-knitr" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>, <a href="#ref-bookdown" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>; Zhu <a href="#ref-kableExtra" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>. The <i>ggplot2</i> library is loaded for the example data set that is used <span class="citation">(Wickham <a href="#ref-ggplot2" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>. The <i>Hmisc</i> and <i>DT</i> libraries provide functions needed to make and display the analytic data set <span class="citation">(Harrell Jr, Charles Dupont, and others. <a href="#ref-Hmisc" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>; Xie, Cheng, and Tan <a href="#ref-DT" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.</p>

<h1>Analytic Data</h1>
<p>This analytic data is created using the <i>datatable</i> function of the <i>DT</i> library. There are many options here, so I will only cover the high points. For more information check out the excellent documentation <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/DT/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>The main things I want to show are the extensions declared by the <i>extensions</i> argument. The <i>Buttons</i> option creates buttons so that the end user can download the data set in various formats. The <i>KeyTable</i> allows users to select cells within the table and navigate similar to how they would in spreadsheet software. The <i>FixedColumns</i> allows us to create fixed columns that follow the cursor and scroll bars.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is to remove commas from the analytic data set if you want to allow users to export to a CSV format.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>commas &lt;- lapply(mpg, grep, pattern = &quot;,&quot;)
commas &lt;- names(which(unlist(lapply(commas, length)) &gt; 0))

datatable(mpg, escape = FALSE,
